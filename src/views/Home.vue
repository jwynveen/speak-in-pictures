        <blockquote>
          "I can't draw, and I can't find it on Google!"
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <p>Sometimes, it's really hard to draw a concept, but it's important to associate that word or phrase in your new language with the idea it holds instead of the exact word in your own language (because we all know there isn't a one-to-one correlation).</p>
